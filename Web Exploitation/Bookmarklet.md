# Problem
Why search for the flag when you can make a bookmarklet to print it for you?  
**Hint 1:** A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.  
**Hint 2:** What happens when you click a bookmarklet?  
**Hint 3:** Web browsers have other ways to run JavaScript too.

# Solution
Copy the code in the given box, open the debugging console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I), navigate to the Console tab, paste the code, and press Enter. The flag will be printed on your screen.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{p@g3_turn3r_e8b2d43b}`
