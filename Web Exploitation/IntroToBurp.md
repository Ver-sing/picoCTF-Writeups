# Problem
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

**Hint 1:** Try using Burp Suite to intercept requests and capture the flag.

**Hint 2:** Try modifying the request; maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

# Solution
As mentioned, you need to set up Burp Suite. Here is a brief guide to help you:

1. Install Burp Suite Community Edition and the FoxyProxy extension in your browser.
2. Configure FoxyProxy: Go to Options > Proxies > Add. Name it "Burp Suite", set Type to "HTTP", Hostname to `127.0.0.1`, and Port to `8080`. Customize the color if you wish; leave other fields blank.
3. Open Burp Suite, click "Next" through the setup, and go to the "Proxy" tab. Do not change any settings yet.

- Fill out the form as instructed.
- When you reach the "2FA authentication" step, turn intercept on in Burp Suite.
- Enter any number in the OTP field and press submit.
- The intercepted request will appear in Burp Suite.
- Scroll down in the request to find a line like `otp=4555`.
- Carefully remove it completely, but do not delete any lines.
- Forward the modified request to the server.
- You should now see the flag on the screen.

You will see the flag on the screen.
