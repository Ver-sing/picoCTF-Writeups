# Problem
I don't like scrolling down to read the code on my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

**Hint 1:** Try pressing `CTRL+U` (Windows/Linux) or `âŒ˜+U` (Mac) in your browser to view the page source. You can also add `view-source:` before the URL, or use                 `curl <URL>` in your shell.

**Hint 2:** Minification reduces the size of code but does not change its functionality.

**Hint 3:** What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting features.

# Solution

Open your browser's developer tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`). In the "Elements" or "Inspector" tab, expand the `<body>` section. Locate and expand the `<div class="picoctf{}" style="width:70%">` tag to find the flag.

Alternatively, press `Ctrl+U` to view the page source and scroll horizontally (drag the scrollbar to the right) to find the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_ed938a7e}`
