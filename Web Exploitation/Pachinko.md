# Problem
History has failed us, but no matter.

# Solution
This challenge doesn't offer much for learning, except that you learn about Pachinko and NAND gates.
 You don't even need to draw the circuitâ€”just repeatedly click the submit button. Eventually, you'll receive the flag. Alternatively, you can use Burp Suite: capture the request, send it to the repeater, and keep sending requests until you get the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{p4ch1nk0_f146_0n3_e947b9d7}`
