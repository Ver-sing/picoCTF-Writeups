# Problem
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out which one is the best: [http://mercury.picoctf.net:17781/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:17781/)

# Solution
The site accepts several types of cookies: "snickerdoodle", "peanut butter", "sugar", and "butter". Each has an assigned value: 0, 5, 7, and 11, respectively. To get the flag, you need to update the cookie value. This can be done using Burp Suite. (Skip to step 4 if you're already familiar with Burp Suite.)

1. Install Burp Suite Community Edition and the FoxyProxy extension in your browser.
2. Configure FoxyProxy: Go to Options > Proxies > Add. Name it "Burp Suite", set Type to "HTTP", Hostname to `127.0.0.1`, and Port to `8080`. Customize the color if you wish; leave other fields blank.
3. Open Burp Suite, click "Next" through the setup, and go to the "Proxy" tab. Do not change any settings yet.

4. Enter any of the above mentioned cookie names on the site. Before submitting, turn intercept on in Burp Suite. Send the first request as it is. In the second request, you will see:
    ```
    Cookie: name=11
    ```
    Change it to:
    ```
    Cookie: name=18
    ```
    This will give you the flag.

If you are using Burp Suite Pro, you can perform a brute force attack (try values from 1 to 100) to obtain the flag.
