# Problem

Can you win convincingly against this chess bot? He won't go easy on you!

**Hint:** Try understanding the code and how the WebSocket client is interacting with the server.

# Solution

To get the flag from chess master Fish, you just need to defeat it (very, very badly).

If you are familiar with Burp Suite, you can skip the next few steps.

1. Install Burp Suite Community Edition and the FoxyProxy extension in your browser.
2. Configure FoxyProxy: Go to Options > Proxies > Add. Name it "Burp Suite", set Type to "HTTP", Hostname to `127.0.0.1`, and Port to `8080`. Customize the color if you wish; leave other fields blank.
3. Open Burp Suite, click "Next" through the setup, and go to the "Proxy" tab. Do not change any settings yet.

Turn intercept on, and then play a move. You will see something like `eval -17` in the captured responses. Just change it to `eval -100000` and you will get the flag.

PS: If you truly want to defeat the fish, you can use this [website](https://nextchessmove.com/).
