# Problem
Can you get the flag?  
**Hint:** Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

# Solution
1. Open the debugging console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
2. For Edge:
    - Go to the "Sources" tab.
    - Expand "Page" (content scripts).
    - Look for `script.js` and `style.css`. Both files contain partial flags. Combine them to get the full flag.
3. For Chrome and Firefox:
    - Go to the Style Editor and find `style.css` for the first half of the flag.
    - Then, go to the Debugger tab and find `script.js` for the second half of the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_6edef411}`
