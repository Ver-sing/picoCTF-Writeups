# Problem
Welcome to the challenge! In this task, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.

The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including one about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files containing the serverâ€™s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.
