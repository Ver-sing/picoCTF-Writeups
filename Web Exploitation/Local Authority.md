# Problem
Can you get the flag?

**Hint:** How is the password checked on this website?

# Solution
1. Enter random values for "username" and "password," then click Login.  
2. When the login fails, open the debugging console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).  
3. Go to Sources or Debugger (depending on your browser), and find the `secure.js` file.  
4. You will see both `username="admin"` and `password="strongPassword0XXXXX"` there. Copy both values and paste them into the login page. The flag will be displayed on the screen.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_b0c2c9cb}`
