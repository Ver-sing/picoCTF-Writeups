# Problem

Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?

**Hint 1:** Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the webpage?  
**Hint 2:** Cookies aren't just for eating—they're also used in web technologies!  
**Hint 3:** Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.

# Solution

1. Enter a random username and password.  
2. On the new page, Right-click (or press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and select "Inspect".
3. Look for the "Application" or "Storage" tab (varies by browser), then find the Cookies section.
4. You will see a base64-encoded string. Copy and decode it using any online decoder or this command:

    ```
    echo 'cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzk4RDA2MDNGfQ==' | base64 --decode
    ```
    You may find the string ending with "%3D%3D"—these are URL encodings for "==". Used "==" here to avoid errors.
